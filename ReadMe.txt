 In this project, five bus routes in Nottingham city area were selected and AVL data and timetable data were collected for each route from 2nd August to 15th August 2023.

The service quality of the bus route was assessed by calculating three parameters, which are On-time Performance, Headway Adherence, and Wait time. 

It also selects three classification models of machine learning: logistic regression, decision tree and K-nearest neighbour model, to help users to predict the status of bus arrival in advance
